                         <p>Your dissertation or thesis paper is one of the most important pieces of research you'll conduct in college or university. Love it or hate it, all the hard work and efforts you put in college will eventually come down to this piece of paper.<br>For some courses, the score you get on the dissertation paper can account for up to 70% of your final grade. To that end, your dissertation score can make the difference between nailing the course with a distinction or an average score.<br>
                        However, the dissertation paper isn't the easiest to work on. In fact, it's the most challenging paper you'll handle in your entire academic life. Because it requires a lot of time and commitment, many students feel disinclined to take the paper while others feel like they aren't qualified enough to write a dissertation.</p>

                         <h2>But Why Is Dissertation Writing So Hard?</h2>
                         <p>Dissertation writing is a mammoth task, and every step has its challenges. From creating a topic to researching to following the writing rules...the difficulty just goes up.<br>Unfortunately, dissertation writing is a task you can't escape if you've to go through a college or university. Unlike college essays and other research papers you've been submitting to date, a dissertation involves lengthy content and a specified methodology. In most cases, a dissertation will follow the following structure.</p>

                         <h4>(i) Abstract</h4>
                         <p>An abstract is a short summary of the research article. The abstract concisely report your research's outcome, giving the reader insights into what to expect in your paper. A good abstract should include the research objectives, methods, results, and conclusion.</p>

                          <h4>(ii) Introduction</h4>
                         <p>The introduction is basically an extended version of the abstract. It should introduce the reader to data and information related to the topic in question—referencing historical facts or any latest development relevant to the research topic.</p>

                          <h4>(iii) Literature Review</h4>
                         <p>A literature review surveys scholarly articles, books, conference proceedings, and other resources relevant to the topic in question. It seeks to substantiate the highlighted points and provides context to a dissertation by identifying past related research.</p>

                          <h4>(iv) Methodology</h4>
                         <p>The methodology provides a broad, philosophical underpinning to your chosen research methods. The research methods used—whether quantitative or qualitative—will be explained here and the reason for the choice of your research methods.</p>

                         <h4>(v) Evidence, Analysis, and Outcomes</h4>
                         <p>This section analyzes all the facts, evidence, and data collected for the research, including the obtained results and outcomes.</p>

                         <h4>(vi) Conclusion</h4>
                         <p>The conclusion presents the results/outcomes of the research concisely and briefly to the reader. Any new knowledge obtained through research is also critiqued in this section.<br>Even a cursory glance at the dissertation structure is enough to tell you that this isn't your ordinary school essay.
