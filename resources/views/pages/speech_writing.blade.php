                        <p>Speech writing is a skill that most writers do not possess. A speech is an expression of thoughts or ideas conveyed verbally to an audience.

                          <p>Ideation is the first step when writing a speech and involves generating viable ideas for your presentation. First, identify all of your speech ideas and write them down on a piece of paper.

For example, you could have ten minutes to give your speech or an entire hour, depending on the purpose of the speech or the function you’re attending.<br>For this reason, it is critical to determine the time allocated for your speech. Doing so can help you determine the ideal length of your speech. If your allotted time is less, you might want to filter your ideas to only include the most important ones in your speech.</p>

                          <p>After you’ve identified the key points, build on them. Provide supporting evidence to back up your claims to make your speech credible. You can make use of relevant examples to keep the audience interested.<br>Your speech should be factual to remove any traces of doubt from the audience. Make sure to incorporate some humor to keep the audience engaged. However, care should be taken when adding humor because a slight mistake could stir up the audience and lessen your credibility.</p>

                          <h5>Step 5: Persuade Your Audience</h5>
                          <p>Finally, ensure your speech is persuasive. Strive to persuade the audience in a sophisticated, thoughtful manner, including quoting a famous author.
