                        <h2>{{ __('Annotated Bibliography-Annotated Bibliography Writing Service') }}</h2>
                           <p>An annotated bibliography is a list of books, articles, and documents that includes explanatory and evaluative remarks about the sources included in your essay. An annotated bibliography is comprised of a Citation and an Annotation.<br>The citation should be formatted in the particular citation style instructed by your professor for the assignment. Frequently used bibliographic styles include Harvard, MLA, Chicago, and APA. Annotations should follow each citation.<br>An annotation is a brief explanatory and evaluative paragraph. Its purpose is to enlighten the reader about the accuracy, quality, and relevance of the sources cited. A well-written annotated bibliography should be just about 100-300 words. It should contain a brief synopsis of the source, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.<br>An annotated bibliography assignment can be a part of a dissertation or a stand-alone test assigned by your tutor to gauge your skills in certain areas. Either way, you may need professional assistance writing it if you’re new to the world of bibliography writing. </p>

                           <h2>Types of Annotations You’ll Come Across</h2>
                           <p>You’ll likely come across this type of assignment in college, so knowing what it entails can be of big help. An annotated bibliography can either be:</p>

                           <h4>Descriptive</h4>
                           <p>A descriptive annotated bibliography gives a synopsis of the source’s primary focus and addresses the fundamental concepts of the work. These annotations usually give a brief summary of the text and include a statement of the main argument (what the book is about).</p>

                           <h4>Evaluative</h4>
                           <p>An evaluative annotated bibliography critically assesses a source’s strengths and weaknesses regarding its quality and relevance. In addition to evaluation remarks, evaluative bibliographies provide judgment—negative or positive—about the work.<br>Typically, this kind of annotations will begin with general commentary about the focus of the source, then move to detailed critiques, followed by evaluative comments.</p>

                           <h4>Informative</h4>
                           <p>An informative annotated bibliography provides a summary of the source. However, unlike a descriptive annotation, it gives factual information about the source, including data, proofs, arguments, and hypothesis.</p>


                           <h4>Combination</h4>
                           <p>Most annotated bibliographies combine the above and contain both the information about the source and a critical evaluation.</p>

                           <h2>Reasons to Buy an Annotated Bibliography from Professionals</h2>
                           <p>On the surface, an annotated bibliography can seem like a simple task to accomplish. After all, it’s a short summary—ranging between 100 – 300 words.<br>However, an annotated bibliography can be one of the most challenging assignments you’ll tackle in college. Why? It requires in-depth research around your topic area or a critical evaluation of a source, and this information will not always be readily available.<br>Moreover, choosing the texts to include in your work can also be difficult, and the process of narrowing down the most relevant sources from an extensive source can be tricky. These tasks can be stressful and time-consuming to a novice writer. Hence, it’s vital that you seek the help of a company experienced in producing annotated bibliography papers.<br>When you entrust a professional to handle the task, they will do it with finesse and accuracy. Professionals know the writing guidelines, including where to source the information, the format to use, and the content to include in your particular assignment.
