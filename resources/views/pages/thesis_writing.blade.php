                        <p>{{ __('Thesis Writing A thesis is a statement that is put forward with the premise of being proven. In other words, a thesis is a long essay that contains the author’s investigation and findings. It is usually written by university degree candidates or applicants for a certified qualification. A thesis is usually arranged in two ways, by monograph or publication. A monograph is a comprehensive written inquiry of a particular specialized topic or a component of it. A monograph usually has a Title, Summary, Foreword, and Table of contents. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements of a thesis in a monograph format.') }}</p>

                         <p>On the other hand, in a publication thesis, the chapters are usually set up as a broad review of the unpublished and published article papers. The structure of a thesis often explains the primary purpose, the methodology used, and the research findings. </p>
                    
                    <h3> What Is the Guideline of Our Thesis Writing Service?</h3>
                    <p>At mycustomessays.com, we follow a specific guideline when writing thesis papers irrespective of the type of thesis and the field of study. This guideline is prepared by experts in thesis writing—having been in the field for more than 20 years. Here's what our thesis writing guideline entails.

                    </p>
                    <h4>Topic Selection and Thesis Proposal</h4>
                    <p>Our experts will help you suggest the topic you wish to write your thesis on by providing viable suggestions. Starting with the topic, our experts will help you create a compelling proposal that will elicit immediate approval.</p>

                     <h4>Research</h4>
                    <p>Once your thesis topic and proposal have been approved, one of our top writers proficient in your field of study will embark on the research quest. Your writer will begin with the brainstorming process, then analyze the tasks in detail to define the project's scope and create an outline. They will then conduct research from reliable sources, amass valuable insights, collect data and facts to be used in the project.</p>

                     <h4>First Draft</h4>
                    <p>Your thesis writer will then prepare a first draft of the project. This first draft will contain all the ideas, facts, and insights collected in the research process. The writer will also find authoritative sources to cite and include them in the draft. At mycustomessays.com, we only cite reputable sources and strive to include current publications and scholarly articles that academicians have approved.</p>

                     <h4>Editing & Formatting</h4>
                    <p>Unlike school assignments and essays, a thesis must follow a specified structure and format. At this stage, your writer will scan the paper to ensure your paper:<br>
                    <i class="ti ti-arrow-circle-right text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i> Is free from grammatical errors and anomalies<br>
                    <i class="ti ti-arrow-circle-right text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i> Follows the approved thesis writing rules<br>
                    <i class="ti ti-arrow-circle-right text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i> Contains sources that are current and reputable<br>
                    <i class="ti ti-arrow-circle-right text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Meets all the instructions laid down by the student<br>
                    Our quality assurance team will then go through the paper to ensure the copy is unique and 100% original. They will check the work for grammatical inconsistencies and review it for relevance to ensure high-quality work that meets all the user instructions.</p>

                    <h2>What You'll Find on Our Thesis Writing Service</h2>
                    <p>It's no secret that our thesis writing service is unique and one of its kind in the industry. Here's a sneak peek into what you'll find on our thesis writing service and why our agency is sought after by students.</p>

                    <h4>Reliability</h4>
                    <p>Unlike content articles for blogs, scholarly work usually has a time limitation. Any late submissions might cost you heavily, and you could even find yourself repeating that academic year. Thus, for any academic writing agency, reliability—which often comes in the form of on-time delivery and quality work, is critical.<br>At mycustomessays.com, we understand the importance of deadlines and have earned a reputation for keeping deadlines. We strive to deliver the work a few days before the deadline to give the student enough time to review the work and request as many revisions as possible. Additionally, we hire only Masters and PH. D holders, so quality will never be a problem.</p>

                    <h4>Custom Papers</h4>
                    <p>Today, you'll find many writing agencies that claim to sell ready-made papers at an affordable price. At mycustomessays.com, we don't sell pre-written papers. All the work we produce is unique, perfectly created, and tailored to your unique instructions and needs.<br>We believe that it would be cheating to sell pre-written papers, so all our papers are written from scratch with an individual approach and according to the student's instructions.</p>

                    <h4>Originality and Confidentiality</h4>
                    <p>All your work will be subjected to our state-of-the-art plagiarism software to ensure no trace of it is found online. Thus, when you order from us, you can expect work that is unique and 100% original. We also promise full confidentiality in our services—your contact info will not be sold online or leaked to any ad agency.</p>

                    <p>Now that you know why we're the trailblazers in research and thesis writing, why not give us a try. Order today, and let us shape your academic journey. </p>
